# 📍 Place Scout

**Place Scout** is a React-based application that allows users to search for places using the Google Places API. It lets users:
- Search a location and nearby places (e.g., restaurants, hospitals)
- View selected place details
- Bookmark places to revisit later

This project demonstrates a clean component-based React architecture, Google Maps/Places integration, and state management using `useState`.
